When running the program, the user will be asked for a file as input. Include the path for the file or
place it in the /src/graphColor directory. The class files are already provided so compiling is
unnecessary.

The file should be formated so the number of vertices in the graph is on the first line, followed by each
vertex, a space, and the next adjacent vertex. For example, if vertex 1 is adjacent to vertices 2 and 3, then make
a line "1 2" followed by a line "1 3". This does not need to be repeated for the opposite direction, so
"2 1" is not neccassary.

Example input files and their corresponding outputs are provided in /example_inputs and /example_outputs
respectively.
